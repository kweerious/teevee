                    <h3>What is WFTDA.tv?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA.tv is a collaboration between the Women's Flat Track Roller Derby Association (WFTDA), its member leagues, and Blaze Streaming Media to offer live coverage of this fast-paced, flat track sport. WFTDA.tv is an online broadcast channel featuring WFTDA-sanctioned games, including every minute of the Playoffs and Championships. It features monthly match-ups of WFTDA contenders and houses a free library of archived footage.</p>

                    <h3>What is WFTDA.tv's Mission?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA.tv plans to present high-quality productions of exciting WFTDA match-ups, encouraging new viewers to join us in our derby addiction, and to reinforce the love of the game for all viewers. Proceeds from WFTDA.tv are reinvested into the membership's programming and will help strengthen our common goals. WFTDA.tv represents our commitment to our member leagues, their skaters and support staff, and all who enjoy the sport.</p>

                    <h3>Why WFTDA.tv? Why Now?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA game play represents the premiere incarnation of the sport in the world, and WFTDA.tv will give fans an equivalent venue to follow flat-track action. We believe that the sport deserves to be broadcast professionally, with consistent standards and parameters. By generating this product in-house, we retain control over the image and assets so they can be distributed in a way that respects the skaters and positively promotes roller derby at every level. The WFTDA is "for the skaters, by the skaters," and this endeavor reflects that mission.</p>

                    <h3>How is WFTDA.tv funded?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA.tv is funded by both Blaze Streaming Media and the WFTDA. The season-long project represents a significant financial commitment by the WFTDA, with early season coverage broadcast free of charge, and a playoff season that will be pay-per-view only.</p>

                    <p>In order to make the experience as fan-friendly as possible, WFTDA.tv subscription costs will be significantly lower than rates charged during the 2011 WFTDA Playoffs and Championships. Coupled with sponsorship funds, the project intends to recoup its investment with affordable pay-per-view streaming. Profits from the project will be put toward maintaining the WFTDA.tv website and reinvestment in additional WFTDA projects and programming.</p>

                    <h3>How much will bouts cost to watch?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA.tv will offer its summer season of live bouts–including ECDX 2012–for free, with event archives available at no charge to viewers.</p>

                    <p>The live broadcasts of the 2012 WFTDA Playoffs and Championships will be available for pay-per-view costs. WFTDA.tv is excited to let viewers know that these pay-per-view costs have been cut by nearly half the rate of the 2011 WFTDA Playoffs and Championships. At only $12 per tournament weekend, WFTDA.tv will also offer free audio podcasts for all pay-per-view bouts and free on-demand archives following the events. All-inclusive WFTDA Playoffs and Championships viewing packages will be available for $50, and Championships will be $20 for the weekend.</p>

                    <h3>Where can I find archived bouts?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA.tv will offer free archives of its productions following the events. Free archives will also be available on-demand after each WFTDA Playoffs and Championships weekend. Throughout the season, viewers will be able to locate all of our great content in one convenient location – WFTDA.tv!</p>

                    <h3>What's the process for getting a WFTDA league-created bout production broadcast on WFTDA.tv?</h3>

                    <p>WFTDA.tv is looking to include league-produced content on the site, and to offer leagues additional exposure and promotion for the hard work and exceptional production. The site offers the convenience of one location for all WFTDA content. If your league is currently producing video broadcasts we would love to talk to you about working with WFTDA.tv.
