WFTDA-dot-TEEVEE prototype
====

This site was used as a prototype to launch the new Broadcasting Program in 2012. It was eventually replaced with a more accessible CMS, but this repo exists as an example of a simple prototype used to launch a big idea and an example of how to integrate with the Rinxter JS API.

This project includes some basic templates split out into SSI includes. It's a quick and dirty way to leverage plain old HTML which was helpful for working with a web savvy frontend person.

This would probably only be helpful if you are toying with the Stats Repo provided through Rinxter or if you are curious how to set up a quick and dirty static site. I am mostly putting this here to get `rinx-reports.js` shared somewhere to make it easier to talk about.
